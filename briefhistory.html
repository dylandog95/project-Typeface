				<h2>A Brief History of Print</h2>
				<p>Many people tend to believe that printing started in Europe with the invention of Gutenberg's printing press. However, this is simply not true. Printing was first invented by the Chinese no later than the 7th century A.D. This early form of printing used xylography (i.e. woodblock printing) to impress words onto paper. Paper was in wide use in China, as well as Japan and Korea, well before it was used in Europe. Many of these texts were single page religious works.<sup>[<a href= "footerWrapper">1</a>]</sup></p>
				<p>The printing press as many would think of it wasn't invented until 1439 by a German goldsmith, Johannes Gutenberg. The press was hand powered and based off of oil and wine presses of the time. With it, Gutenberg invented metal moveable type. Eventually, in 1814, the first steam-powered presses were invented. Later, in the 20th century, electric presses saw their first use.<sup>[<a href= "footerWrapper">2</a>]</sup> His invention would be a new revelution for Europe. Many would argue that this impact was immediate and widespread. Others would argue that many other factors played roles in the changes that Europe saw at the time.</p>
				<p>Gutenberg's press paved the way for new disciplines such as publishing, typography, book-binding, etc. People working in printing shops specialized in certain jobs such as inking, page layout, and typesetting.</p>
				<p>The impact that printing had on the world is a hotly debated topic. Scholars such as Elizabeth Eisenstein, in her book <em>The Printing Press as an Agent of Change</em>, would argue that the printing press had immediate and widespread affects on European society. Other scholars debate her, citing the lack of great and widespread change in China. Thus, it is important to consider that other factors played a role in the changes seen in Europe.</p>
				<p>Regardless, the centuries after the invention of Gutenberg's press saw a significant increase in literacy, science, and other academic fields. For the purposes of this project, the affects of printing technology are still seen today. Printing is still a vital technology even though it has progressed much since its inception. Today we have laser printers, and computer word processing, but, as we will see, the concept of the internet and the invention of the World Wide Web has once again changed writing technology.</p>
