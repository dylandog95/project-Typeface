				<h2>Coding</h2>
				<p>The foundation of every website is its coding. How a site, or program, is coded varies greatly from project to project. Luckily, the foundation of every website is rather simple. There is two languages that nearly every website is built upon. The first is HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, which is a markup language used to describe the content of a webpage. The language consists of elements which enclose text and describe what it is. For example, is the block of text a heading or paragraph. Is the text bold or italicized? These elements 'markup' the language so the web browser knows what it is. It describes the text so a designer can then use CSS to manipulate the text's look on the page.</p>
				<p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language that consists of properties that can be assigned to HTML elements. What is the font size of that paragraph? What color is that element's background? It is the style of the website. In a previous section, we referred to it as the <strong>forme</strong> of the page.</p>
				<p>With HTML and CSS, basic websites can be constructed. In fact, this website was coded using only these two languages. These languages, among others, are how a designer can communicate with a web browser. It is in these two languages that the legacy of print can be seen.</p>
				<p>Most notably, CSS terminology is strongly influenced by print terminology. For example, CSS handles typefaces and fonts. In handling fonts, CSS refers to <strong>font-size</strong>, <strong>font-kerning</strong> (i.e. space between letters), <strong>font-family</strong> (i.e. typeface), <strong>line-height</strong>, and others. One may notice that in referencing typeface CSS uses font-family. This brings up an interesting difference with the digitization of printing. With the advent of word processors such as Microsoft Word, developers decided the most effective way to refer to typeface was 'font' since whenever a user chose a typeface, the program attributed a size and weight to it, making it a font. While this was convenient, many who were unfamiliar with printing would consider font synonymous with typeface. So, today, many consider them such.</p>
				<p>The third layer of development is JavaScript. It is the basis of interactivity and responsiveness in a website. It is a scripting language with object-oriented elements. It resembles more traditionally programming languages such as C, C++, and Java. It is much more powerful than just using HTML and CSS and allows for complex website design. Some examples would be dynamic websites such as Facebook, or Amazon. These websites can respond to user imput, be constantly updated quickly and be responsive to changing screen sizes. It is where web design reveals its computer science background.</p>
				<p>While the ultimate goal of coding websites is the actual presentation of the page to the user, it is important to consider the organization of code behind the scenes. That is when web design diverges from print technology. Coding is a complex issue to cover in the scope of this project, but one can consider that with this complexity comes a readability issue for coders reading other coder's work. Two concepts are key to coding, efficiency and readability, or organization. Efficiency is important because in coding there are many different ways to get from point A to point B. Some ways take longer than others, and some are just more confusing to follow. This is why it is important to consider the ways you take. Organization is important because code needs to be readable to other coders. Most of the time, coding is a group activity, if your group members can't read it, they can't work with it.</p>
				<p>Web design is an art and a science, and unlike old fashioned printing, it can be done by one person sitting in a chair. That doesn't mean that the labor isn't there. In many ways, the digitization of print has made the process much faster. Coding, or programming, is the new basis on which print can be achieved. It is so pervasive in daily life that is important that people understand how it works at a basic level. Web development is a good place for people to start and hopefully you can consider the resources provided later in this project to learn.</p>
