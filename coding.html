				<h2>Coding</h2>
				<p>The foundation of every website is its coding. Depending on the website, how it is coded varies greatly. Luckily, the foundation of every website is rather simple. There is two languages that every website is built upon. The first is HTML, of HyperText Markup Language, which is a markup language used to describe the content of a webpage. The language consists of elements which enclose text and describe what it is. For example, is the text of a heading, or paragraph. Is the text bold or italicized? These elements 'markup' the language so the web browser knows what it is. It describes the text so a designer can then use CSS to manipulate the text's look on the page.</p>
				<p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language that consists of properties that can be assigned to HTML elements. What is the font size of that paragraph? What color is that element's background? It is the style of the website. In a previous section, we referred to it as the <strong>forme</strong> of the page.</p>
				<p>With these two languages, basic websites can be constructed. In fact, this website was coded using only these two languages. These languages, among others, are how a designer can communicate with a web browser. It is in these two languages that the legacy of print can be seen.</p>
				<p>Most notably, CSS terminology is strongly influenced by print terminology. For example, CSS handles typefaces and fonts. In handling fonts, CSS refers to <strong>font-size</strong>, <strong>font-kerning</strong> (i.e. space between letters), <strong>font-family</strong> (i.e. typeface), <strong>line-height</strong>, and others. One may notice that in reference typeface CSS uses font-family. This brings up an interesting difference with the digitization of printing. With the advent of word processors such as Microsoft Word, developers decided the most effective way to refer to typeface was 'font' since whenever a user chose a typeface, the program attributed a size and weight to it, making to it a font. While this was convenient, many who were unfamiliar with printing would consider font synonymous with typeface. So, today, many consider them such.</p>
				<p>While the ultimate end goal of coding websites is the actual presentation of the page to user, it is important to consider the organization of code. That is when web design diverges from print technology. Coding is a complex issue to cover in the scope of this project, but one can consider that with this complexity comes a readability issue for coders reading other coder's work. Two concepts are key to coding, efficiency and readability, or organization. Efficiency is important because in coding there are many different ways to get from point A to point B. Some ways take longer than others, and some are just more confusing to follow. This is why it is important to consider the ways you take. Organization is important because code needs to readable to any other coder. Most of the time, coding is a group activity, if your group members can't read it, they can't work with it.</p>
