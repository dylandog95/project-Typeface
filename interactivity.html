				<h2>Interactivity</h2>
				<p>Nowadays, with the widespread use of smartphones and tablets, web users now access the internet through many differing screen sizes and input methods. Because of this, a web designer needs to consider how their website looks on different devices. This is called <strong>responsive design</strong>.</p>
				<p>It is easy to take for granted a website's ability to work on every device we access it. By now we have become accustomed to the idea of a mobile website, one that works well on smaller touchscreens. In responsive design, a web designer uses JavaScript and CSS to create responsive, or relative designs. JavaScript is a scripting language which has object-oriented elements much like traditional programing languages such as C, C++, or Java. This allows a web designer to communicate to a computer when to perform certain actions, so it can properly respond to a different web browser.</p>
				<p>Much like HTML and CSS, JavaScript is read by the web browser. It requires a <strong>runtime environment</strong> to be executed. In other words, it can't be read by the computer directly. Instead, it requires the web browser to interperet it.</p>
				<p>The interactivity of the web can have other meanings as well. Traditionally, print technology has been bound to physical paper and had limited intertextuality. In other words, one could cite works within a work and point the reader to other written texts. Or, a meta could be created centered around a work if an author alludes to other works by different authors. With the digitization of print technology, and within the scope of this project, the web, intertextuality takes on a more immediate meaning. An old, but foundational, concept of web design is the <strong>hyperlink</strong>. You probably have encounter hyperlinks if you have ever browsed the internet. Traditionally, they are keywords often stylized as blue underlined text. Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">this</a>. And just like that, you have used a hyperlink! This allows the web to become an immediate intertextual form of publication.</p>
				<p>The possiblities of hyperlinks is best exemplified in Wikipedia's use of them. Whenever a user visits a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> page, they sometimes unknowlingly will use hyperlinks to gain information on keywords. This allows an author to be effecient with information. If an author presents a concept or keyword that needs more explanation, that author can then hyperlink another page describing that item. This is important to viewing the web as a new form of publication. It builds upon print technology because it allows for immediate interactivity, something that previous writing technologies can't achieve.</p>
