				<h2>Interactivity</h2>
				<p>Traditionally, print technology has been bound to physical paper and had limited intertextuality. In other words, one could cite works within a work and point the reader to other written texts. Or, a meta could be created centered around a work if an author alludes to other works by different authors. With the digitization of print technology through the use of the web,  intertextuality takes on a more immediate meaning. An old, but foundational, concept of web design is the <strong>hyperlink</strong>. You probably have encountered hyperlinks if you have ever browsed the internet. Traditionally, they are keywords often stylized as blue underlined text. Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">this</a>. And just like that, you have used a hyperlink! This allows the web to become an immediate intertextual form of publication.</p>
				<p>The possiblities of hyperlinks is best exemplified by a Wikipedia page. Whenever a user visits a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> page, they are greeted with a lot of information they might not be familiar with. Wikipedia uses hyperlinks to hightlight this keywords and provide a link to another page describing that item. Users sometimes unknowlingly will use hyperlinks to gain information on keywords automatically. This allows an author to be effecient with information. If an author presents a concept or keyword that needs more explanation, that author can then hyperlink another page describing that item. This is important to viewing the web as a new form of publication. It builds upon print technology because it allows for immediate interactivity, something that previous writing technologies couldn't achieve.</p>
				<p>The web is a diverse, ever-changing pool of information. In many ways, the rate in which we transfer information today is astronomically faster than in the past. Today, the widespread adoption of the smartphone and tablet has brought on a new concept of the computer. We have more access to the World Wide Web than ever before. With mobile networks we never have to leave the influence of the web. This is why it is such a revolutionary writing technology. It is a widespread, immediate change to our society. It is a signal of an increasingly globalized society and brings everyone closer together. So, web design is a vital part of this ecosystem. Web designers are the people who bridge the gap between the user and the web. A well designed web makes for more efficiency and allows for a better interaction with technology.</p>
