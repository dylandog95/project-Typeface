				<h2>Page Layout</h2>
				<p>Within web design, page layout is an important concept. It is how the user is presented information. Page layout is something that every web user is familiar with. Some common elements are, headers, navigation bars, side bars, and footers. While navigation bars aren't necessarily a concept borrowed from print, headers and footers certainly are.</p>
				<p>A header is the top of the page, something that is descriptive of what the website contains, it usually contains a company's logo or name, and some other slogans, or even navigation. It works much like a header on a print page, usually these consist of the same elements. In a book, it may include the title of the book, or chapter, and sometimes a page number to inform the user of their location in the book. The footer might also serve any one of these same purposes. In web design, the same principles are used. It is important to make sure the user knows where they are on your site. The header and footer often provide visual clues that most users are familiar with because of print books.</p>
				<p>Even small things that we might take for granted, such as the way in which we read affects page design. The navigation bar on this webpage is on the left side. For English readers this is a logical position for navigation because we read left to right. Our eyes start on the left side of the page automatically to read.</p>
				<p>Another important concept of page layout is its artistic design. Pages should be pleasing to the eye. Good design allows for the user to find information on your page with ease. Artistic design, along with logical design, allows for an easy to read page.</p>
				<p>The presentation of text on a page is a concept that was first used in early printing. For example, the Gutenberg press used a <strong>chase</strong> to align type on lines of the page. Along with <strong>furniture</strong>, the chase was placed into a <strong>forme</strong>. After placement the forme would be inked and placed in the press. From there, the forme would be pressed onto paper.<sup>[<a href= ".footerWrapper">1</a>]</sup></p>
				<p>In web design we see this in the grid layouts of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS is a stylesheet language that describes the presentation of an HTML or XML document.<sup>[<a href= "#footerWrapper">2</a>]</sup> This language works much like the chase, furniture, and forme of the printing press. In basic CSS grid composition, gutters descibe the space between grid elements such as rows and columns. Within these rows and columns, smaller elements described in HTML can then be described using terms such as padding, and margins. Padding is the space between the content of an element, like the text of a paragraph and the outer border of the element. Margins describe space between the borders of the elements.</p>
				<p>Visualizing the forme of a printing press helps to conceptualize a CSS grid and many of the same principles of printing can be applied to webpage design. However, one needs to consider the needs of a modern website, such as navigation and responsive design. Nonetheless, it is important to realize the legacy of page layout from print to web.</p>
